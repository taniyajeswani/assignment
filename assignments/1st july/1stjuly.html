    <h1><u>Section 1: My Favorite Hobbyüåº</u></h1>
    <p><pre><i>
        My Favorite hobby is to make <em><strong>goals and work towards them</strong></em>, this has been 
        a survival or me because I was not this alive and present before, I had bad habits
        which caused to so much of clutter and feeling of hopelessness in life and this hobby 
        made me who I am right now, it is fun because now I have been doing it since months
        but I truly like to do this.

        Another favorite hobby is running and learning positive mindset from people,situations,
        experiences and internet.i like listening to audio books on self knowledge and ways of living
        life. Dancing used to be my one of the favorite because it sed to help me to face sadness, whenever
        I used to feeling like I am thinking too much I used to dance.
